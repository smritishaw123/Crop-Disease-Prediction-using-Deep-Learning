🌾 Crop Pest and Disease Detection using Deep Learning
📑 Project Overview
Crop diseases are a major threat to global food security. Our solution uses MobileNetV2-based deep learning models to instantly identify leaf diseases from images with high accuracy. This system is designed for real-time image analysis through a Streamlit web application.





👥 The Team (MCA 3rd Semester)
This project was a collaborative effort by 5 students:
Smriti Shaw (16971024008) 
Sriparna Majumder (16971024003) 
Tannistha Ghosh (16971024007) 
Prerona Das (16971024062) 
Priya Singh (16971024064) 
Guided by: Prof. Subir Panja 

🛠️ System Architecture
The pipeline includes:


Input Image: User uploads a leaf photo.



Preprocessing: Data preparation for the model.


Feature Extraction: Using MobileNetV2 architecture.



Model Training & Evaluation: Comparing performance across 22 disease categories.



Output: Real-time prediction with confidence percentage (%).
